        <h2> Essential Workers Are Key to Subway's Ongoing Recovery </h2>

        <p> Before the pandemic arrived in New York City, the subway carried an average of 5.5 million people every weekday. Now, ridership on the subway is at 30% of pre-pandemic levels, according to the New York Times. Many of the riders are
          essential workers who are once again using the subway to commute.</p>
        <p> Sarah Feinberg, interim president of New York City Transit, which runs the city's subway and buses, told the New York Times that: </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/nyregion/subway-ridership-mta.html"> “At the beginning of all of this back in March, we saw that the folks who were continuing to use the system were essential workers. Today it continues
          to be those essential workers and folks with the longest commutes who come into work
          every day because they cannot do their jobs from home.” </blockquote>
        <p> The M.T.A. was unavailable for comment when contacted on Friday. </p>
        <p> Stations located in the outerboroughs and in low-income community districts are responsible for driving the budgetarily insignificant, yet noticeable, increase in traffic. Low-income neighborhoods in east Brooklyn and the Bronx are
          home to the most significant resurgence of traffic. While downtown and midtown Manhattan, with the exception of Chinatown and the Lower East Side, are still waiting for their resurgence.
